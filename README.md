## 🔑 Concepts Covered

Throughout the assignment, the following important concepts of arrays and their applications are explored:

- **Array Basics**
  - Declaration, initialization, and traversal
  - Single-dimensional arrays
  - Input and output of array elements

- **Array Operations**
  - Searching and accessing elements
  - Insertion and deletion
  - Removing duplicates
  - Breaking a number into digits using arrays

- **Mathematical Operations with Arrays**
  - Summation of elements
  - Diagonal sum in matrices
  - Scalar and matrix expressions (e.g., `XA + YB`)
  - Symmetric matrix check

- **2D Arrays (Matrices)**
  - Reading and displaying matrices
  - Performing operations on rows and columns
  - Matrix manipulations for solving problems

- **Pointers with Arrays**
  - Pointer arithmetic in 1D arrays
  - Pointer to a 2D array
  - Accessing array elements via pointers

- **Floating Point Arrays**
  - Handling arrays of floats/doubles
  - Performing calculations with decimal precision

- **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**
  - Conceptual questions to test understanding of arrays, memory allocation, and indexing.
